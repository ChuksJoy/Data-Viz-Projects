## AtliQ Hardware HR Insight Report.
HR in AtliQ Hardware wants insights to;

Working Preference of Employees, i.e., if the love to work from home or on site, will help AtliQ Hardware HR and management wants to know when the employees will be available in the office and when they won't. The percentage of employees at each time, the influence of the holidays on the presence of people at the office and so on.
