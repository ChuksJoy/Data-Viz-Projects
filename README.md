# Data-Viz-Projects
These are some of the Visualization/report projects I have done. 

#1. Festman Hotel Bookings Report.

This is a dashboard designed with Power BI showing an analysis of hotel bookings.

#2. HR analytics Report.

Did a HR analysis of departments and employees depending on the employee status.
From my analysis; was able to find out the Total, Average, Maximum and Minimum Salary paid by the company, 
the department with the highest number of employees and well as the lowest.
Total number of employees and number of employees by their status(Full time, Contract, hourly, etc.

#3. Data Professionals Survey Report.

I was able to design a dashboard for Data Professionals.
[Alex Freberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-freberg/)did a survey on data professionals to find out their current job title, salary, 
how happy they are with their position, salary, demography etc.. 
and with the data gotten from that survey which you can find [here](https://lnkd.in/dm-8zitq) was able to design a dashboard on POWER BI.

#4. AtliQ Hardware Sales Analysis Report.

The sales manager of AtliQ needed a simple report to give him insights as to how sales were going for AtliQ Hardware
With the data provided on by [Codebasics](https://github.com/codebasics), was able to explore the data with MySQL and prepare a report on Powerbi.
